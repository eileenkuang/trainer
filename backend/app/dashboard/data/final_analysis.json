  "general_summary": "Overall, you've shown a great start with your form, achieving a perfect repetition with excellent spinal alignment. However, there are a few areas to focus on for consistent improvement, specifically keeping your head neutral, ensuring a full lockout, and controlling your tempo during the eccentric phase. With a little practice on these points, your form will become much more stable and efficient!",
