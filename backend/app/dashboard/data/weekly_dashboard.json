    "arms_analysis": "Arms showed significant improvement this week, moving from issues like 'Elbow Flare' and 'Rushed Tempo' in earlier sessions to demonstrating 'Controlled Tempo' and proper 'Elbow Tuck' in higher-scoring workouts. This indicates good progress in upper body strength and movement control.",
    "legs_analysis": "Legs, specifically ankle stability, have become a recent area of concern. The latest sessions highlight 'Right Ankle Instability' and general 'Ankle Stability' issues, which negatively impacted overall form despite improvements elsewhere. This suggests a need for focused remedial work to build a stable foundation.",
    "core_analysis": "Core stability has shown excellent progression. Initially, 'Hip Sag' and 'Core Instability' were primary faults in lower-scoring sessions. Through consistent effort, the core has become a 'Stable Core' and a consistent strength in your highest-scoring workouts, demonstrating effective bracing and midline control."
