    "arms_analysis": "Arm strength showed inconsistency with recurring elbow flare issues during mid-week sessions. While elbow tuck technique improved in intermediate sessions (score 85), flare resurfaced when fatigued. Recent session demonstrated control during push movements but requires ongoing reinforcement.",
    "legs_analysis": "Leg engagement remains underdeveloped with ankle instability appearing as sudden weakness in latest session. While maintaining plank position, legs lacked consistent drive to stabilize movement chain. Proper foot positioning regressed under fatigue conditions.",
    "core_analysis": "Core stability showed significant progression - early severe hip sag issues evolved into bracing strength by later sessions. Neutral spine maintenance improved notably, though endurance faltered under advanced loads. Recent midline integrity indicates developing core resilience."
