    "arms_analysis": "User demonstrates advanced elbow control in pushups with mastery at angles below 45°, but exhibits instability during lower-body movements. Recent squat sessions show compensatory arm movements during balance challenges.",
    "legs_analysis": "Significant instability patterns observed in ankles/knees across multiple sessions. Asymmetric acceleration creates joint shear forces. Hip drive imbalance persists during squat descent despite glute activation cues.",
    "core_analysis": "Core bracing improves during upper-body work but collapses under lower-body load. Spinal alignment failure occurs specifically when lower extremity instability creates compensatory leaning."
