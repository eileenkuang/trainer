    "arms_analysis": "Arms showed consistent strength in elbow tuck and good wrist position during pushup variations. However, challenges with 'Elbow Flare' and 'Rushed Tempo' indicate a need for sustained focus on controlled eccentric movements and maintaining proper elbow mechanics under load.",
    "legs_analysis": "Legs analysis reveals significant and recurring issues with ankle stability (both left and right), 'Excessive ankle acceleration', 'Hip sagging', and 'Excessive knee acceleration'. These indicate a general lack of control and stability in the lower body, including asymmetric movement patterns, requiring targeted foundational work.",
    "core_analysis": "Core stability presents a dichotomy: it's a noted strength in high-scoring sessions ('Stable Core', 'Neutral Spine'), yet it's also the source of frequent breakdowns like 'Hip Sag', 'Spinal alignment breakdown', 'Lumbar stress', and general 'Core Instability'. This suggests the core performs well when fresh but struggles under fatigue or when compensating for other weaknesses, also indicated by 'Head Dropping'."
